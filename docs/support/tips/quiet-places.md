# Quiet Places on Campus

Campus is big. Like, 430[^1] different buildings big. This makes it real easy to completely miss about 90% of those buildings and study in one of the big buildings that everybody knows about (like the Diamond).

For most people, this is probably fine, but some of us prefer quieter atmospheres, especially during exam season where everyone and their dog is trying to study. Turns out, there's quite a number of little-known places around campus where students can go study in peace and quiet. Let this page serve to document all those places.

## Committee Central

Committee Central is located on Level 2 of the SU. Historically, it was a meeting place for Committees. In fact, the safe there used to hold all the societies' money. It has plenty of tables, a couple sofas and some pretty comfy d√©cor. 

## 38 Mappin Street

38 Mappin is a building full of small tutorial rooms (seating up to 8), larger classrooms (seating a couple dozen), and 4 big workrooms (seating several hundred). It's usually used for exams, meetings and occassionally for teaching too.

Unfortunately, students can't book rooms in 38 Mappin Street. So, you'll have to try your luck and hope there's an unbooked room that hasn't already been claimed by someone with the same idea as you!

!!! tip
    All of the rooms have a display outside them to show if/when it's booked for the day, but most of these don't work (#BlameTheUni).

## SCS Social Space

Regent Court is home to the School of Computer Science. There is a (relatively small) social space on Level 2 of Regent Court, just across from the SCS Reception, that has a handful of tables, some sofas, a meeting room, and even a piano!

!!! tip
    You can book the meeting room by following the instructions [here](/docs/support/tipsort/tips/meeting-rooms.md).

## Western Bank Library

Not many people know about Western Bank. It used to be the University's main library, before Information Commons was opened in 2007[^2]. Outside of busy times, like exam season and the end of the Semester, Western Bank is often very quiet. Study spaces are located in-between sections of bookshelves, creating a quiet and withdrawn atmosphere. On the downside, this does make it seem like a maze.
