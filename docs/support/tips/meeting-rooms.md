# Meeting Rooms

The University has a variety of different bookable spaces that students can use for their group or virtual meetings. This page contains most of those spaces and information on how you can book them.

## Regent Court

Regent Court has 3 meeting rooms, all of which can only be booked via your University Google Calendar. To make a booking, you need to create a new calendar event, then click "Add a Room", and choose one of the available rooms under Regent Court. If a room is striked out, that means it's unavailable at the time you've chosen.

!!! tip
    Rooms G22 Blue and G22 Orange both have Google Meet Hardware. That means the room has a giant TV and webcam attached to it that you can use to present group meetings to Google Meet, which is great if you're holding the meeting virtually as well.

## Information Commons

The IC has loads of different bookable spaces. These include Uni PCs, individual study pods (which can be used for virtual meetings) and group study rooms. All of these spaces can be booked using the University's [Libcal](https://sheffield.libcal.com/r/new) website.

## The Diamond

The Diamond currently only has group rooms available to be booked. Like IC, these can only be booked through [Libcal](https://sheffield.libcal.com/r/new).

## Western Bank Library

Western Bank also only has group spaces, and is also only bookable through [Libcal](https://sheffield.libcal.com/r/new).
