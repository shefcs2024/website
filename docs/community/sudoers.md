# Sudoers

The [Year Group Discord](index.md) is ran by a handful of volunteers known collectively as the Sudoers (named after the Unix `sudo` command). We are responsible for supporting our year group throughout their time at University in the following ways:

- Sharing important information (e.g. regarding the course, SU events, societies, etc) through the Discord and this website
- Enforcing the [Code of Conduct](coc.md)
- Enabling students to contact their representatives directly when they want to
- Alerting users to important changes in a timely manner

!!! note
    The Sudoers are not affiliated with or regulated by the Students' Union, School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering or the University in any way. We do not receive any kind of funding, and any costs we pay are out of our own pockets.

## Constitution

We are not currently regulated by a Constitution, this may change in the future.

## Become a Sudoer

Anyone under the School of Computer Science is welcome to apply to become a Sudoer. Please [submit this form][discord.sudoers.nominations], and your application will be reviewed and voted on by the current sitting Sudoers.
