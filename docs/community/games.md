# Game Servers

The [Sudoers](sudoers.md) provide, moderate and maintain a number of game servers for the 2024 cohort to enjoy throughout their studies. These are currently provided at no charge to our members through one of our [Sudoers](sudoers.md), who runs the game servers from their home.

## Minecraft

This is a vanilla, survival Minecraft server with support for an unlimited number of active users. In order to join, you will need to be in the [Year Group Discord][discord]. Upon connecting for the first time, you will be kicked and shown a message asking you to go to the [Year Group Discord][discord] and type in a certain command. This will link your Minecraft account to your Discord account, which will do things like import permissions and allow you to communicate to the Discord server via game chat and vice versa.
