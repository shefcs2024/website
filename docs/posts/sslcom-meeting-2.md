## Help & Support

The Library will be making a singular website containing links to all of the University's help and support services.

## Timetabling

Timetabling is done centrally by the University, the School has no control over it. The University is moving to a new system next year, which should help improve scheduling clashes.

## COM1003: Java Programming

This is being reformed into a single-semester module, with all the content condensed into Semester 1. It will remain a 20-credit module.

## COM1005: Machines & Intelligence

The 1st half of Semester 1 is largely disappearing. The 2nd half is expanding somewhat to include more content regarding ethics and legal issues around AI. The Semester 2 content will be merged into COM1009.

## COM1008: Web & Internet Technology

This module is being merged into another module. Only HTML and CSS will be taught, and JavaScript will be removed completely. Students will be taught how to pick up other languages, like JavaScript, quickly in a new 2nd year module called Programming Languages.

## COM1009: Algorithms & Data Structures

This module will increase from 10 credits to 20, and will involve programming with Java rather than writing everything in pseudocode.
