# Hello, World!

Hello and welcome! This website is a sort of knowledge base I decided to make for all the current first years, because I felt information was way too fragmented and in dire need of aggregating.

<!-- more -->

The idea is that the website will be the main way for me, Academic and Society Reps to communicate with the year group as a whole. While it's still a WIP, the plan is for the website to contain:

- Updates on SSLCom and SU Council meetings
- Announcements about current events relevant to first years
- Information about societies and events at the Uni
- Resources to help with your studies
- Events and activities being ran by the Sudoers who run the [Year Group Discord][discord]

We're still working on getting everything onto this website, so keep an eye on it for updates!
