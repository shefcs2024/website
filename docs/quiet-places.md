# Quiet Places on Campus

Campus is big. Like, 430[^1] different buildings big. This makes it real easy to completely miss about 90% of those buildings and study in one of the big buildings that everybody knows about (like the Diamond).

For most people, this is probably fine, but some of us prefer quieter atmospheres, especially during exam season where everyone and their dog is trying to study. Turns out, there's quite a number of little-known places around campus where students can go study in peace and quiet. Let this page serve to document all those places.

## Committee Central



## 38 Mappin Street

38 Mappin is a building full of small tutorial rooms (seating up to 8), larger classrooms (seating a couple dozen), and 4 big workrooms (seating several hundred). It's usually used for exams, meetings and occassionally for teaching too.

Unfortunately, students can't book rooms in 38 Mappin Street. So, you'll have to try your luck and hope there's an unbooked room that hasn't already been claimed by someone with the same idea as you!

??? tip
    All of the rooms have a display outside them to show if/when it's booked for the day, but most of these don't work (#BlameTheUni).
