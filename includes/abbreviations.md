<!-- 
This is a glossary of abbreviations used all across the website.
It is automatically applied to every single page on the website by the renderer, so that they only need to be defined in one place.

Having this glossary means pages don't need to explain what the abbreviations mean, because MkDocs will add a tooltip to the abbreviation for us.

See this link for guidance on adding new definitions:
